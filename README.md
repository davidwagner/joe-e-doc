Joe-E Doc is a version of Javadoc that integrates the taming information for Joe-E. See the Joe-E project for more info.

This is hosted as a separate project because it is based on code from OpenJDK and is thus licensed under the GPL instead of BSD.

See the README for more information about how to install and use this code.
