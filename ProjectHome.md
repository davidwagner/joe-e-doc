Joe-E Doc is a version of Javadoc that integrates the taming information for Joe-E.  See the [Joe-E project](http://joe-e.googlecode.com) for more info.

This is hosted as a separate project because it is based on code from [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) and is thus licensed under the GPL instead of BSD.
