I. Overview
   Joe-edoc is a command line tool for generating html 
   documentation of java source code with additional 
   joe-e input. The additional input comes in the form 
   of .safej files. These files specify which fields, 
   constructors, and methods are enabled and which are 
   suppressed in valid joe-e code. Joe-edoc injects 
   this additional input into javadoc style html pages.
   The result is an API that looks exactly like the 
   standard java documentation but with the additional
   joe-e information

II. How to use
   Joe-edoc works similarly to javadoc. It is called
   via the command line with the same options as javadoc,
   except for the "-doclet" option. All other options 
   are valid. An example call to joe-edoc is:
   $cd joe-edoc
   $./joe-edoc.sh -classpath ~/workspace/myproject/ my.package
   
	 One option not included in the javadoc man page is the
	 ability to specify a directory where safej files are located.
	 The option is "-safejpath." An example using -safejpath is:
   $cd joe-edoc
	 $./joe-edoc.sh -classpath ~/workspace/myproject/ -safejpath ~/safej
      my.package
 
   For additional options see the javadoc man page.

III. Sample .safej file
   A .safej file provides additional information to 
   the joe-edoc application. There should be one .safej
   file per class and the .safej should be placed in the
   same directory as the corresponding .java file. An example
	 is included as String.safej
