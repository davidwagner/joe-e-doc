I. Overview
   Joe-E Doc (joeedoc) is a command line tool for generating HTML documentation
   of Java source code with Joe-E taming information.  This additional input
   comes in the form of .safej files.  These files specify which reference types
   (classes, interfaces, enumerations, annotations) and type members 
   (constructors, methods, fields, enumeration constants, annotation elements)
   are enabled and which are suppressed for Joe-E programs.  Joe-E Doc
   integrates this additional information into JavaDoc, resulting in API
   documentation looks like standard JavaDoc output but with the additional
   information regarding Joe-E taming decisions.

II. Installation
   In order to run the joeedoc wrapper script, one must edit it to
   specify the absolute path to the Joe-E Doc doclet component.
   This is the bin directory in the Joe-E Doc download.  Simply
   change the line beginning BINDIR= to specify this path.  You
   can then move the joeedoc script to somewhere convenient on
   your path, such as ~/bin on a Unix system.

III. How to use
   Joe-E Doc works similarly to javadoc.  It is invoked on the command line with
   the same options as javadoc, except that the "-doclet" option cannot be used,
   as the Joe-E doclet is used.  The general form of an invocation is:

       joeedoc [options] [packages]

   Joe-E Doc adds one command-line option, to specify the path of the
   safej files specifying taming policy.  This option is "-safejpath" followed by
   the name of a single directory containing safej files.  While it is customary
   for the safej files to be arranged in directories reflecting the package
   hierarchy, this is currently not required.

   The most important of JavaDoc's options is -sourcepath, used to specify the
   directory containing the classes to document.

   An typical call to joe-edoc would look like:
   $joeedoc -sourcepath ~/workspace/myproject/ -safejpath ~/safej my.package
